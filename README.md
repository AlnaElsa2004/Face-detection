# Face Detection Project

This project implements face detection using the following techniques:
1. **Haarcascade with OpenCV**
2. **HOG with Dlib**
3. **CNN with Dlib**
4. **Webcam detection** using Haarcascade in VS Code.

All techniques, except the webcam detection, are executed in **Google Colab**, while the webcam detection is implemented in **VS Code** due to Colabâ€™s limitations on accessing the webcam.


## Running the Project

### In Google Colab:
 Run the notebook to perform face detection using Haarcascade, HOG, or CNN.

### In VS Code (Webcam Detection):
1. Open `camera.py` in VS Code.
2. Ensure the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is available in the folder.
3. Run the script to detect faces using your webcam in real time.
